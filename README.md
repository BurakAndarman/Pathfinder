# Further Informations ðŸ‘‡

â–º The program requires a text file named "input" and creates a text file named "output".

â–º You can examine input file to see how graph and it's connections are determined.Big letters represent different kinds of nodes and there are no's beside them.Wanted destinations must be in this file too.

â–º In destinations, only sequential letters (not their numbers) accepted.When the program has executed ,you will find your output file in directory where you put source code file.
