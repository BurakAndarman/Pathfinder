# Pathfinder
A C++ project based on DFS algorithm to traverse through given graph and find out if given path is available or not.
The program requires a text file named "input" and creates a text file named "output".You can examine input file to see how graph and it's connections are determined.Wanted destinations must be in this file too.Big letters represent different kinds of nodes and there are no's beside them.In destinations, only sequential letters (not their numbers) accepted.When the program has executed ,you will find your output file in directory where you put source code file.
